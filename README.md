# WXT + React

This template should help get you started developing with React in WXT.


Objective: Build a Chrome Extension using the wxt.dev framework, with React, to
automate connection requests on LinkedIn.

Assignment Overview:
1. Target URL: The extension should work on the following LinkedIn URL:
https://www.linkedin.com/mynetwork/grow/
2. UI Requirement: Add a button that floats on the page with the text: “Connect
with All”.
3. Functionality: When the “Connect with All” button is clicked, the extension
should automatically trigger a click event for all visible Connect buttons on
the page.
For example, if there are 50 suggested profiles with a Connect button, 50
connection requests should be sent.

Additional Requirements:
1. Include a delay between each connection request to prevent LinkedIn from
blocking the account.
2. The delay can be around 1-3 seconds (you can adjust based on your
judgment).

Constraints:
● Use the wxt.dev framework for the Chrome Extension.
● Make sure the code is clean and well-commented.
● Handle edge cases, such as no connectable profiles available.  can you simplify this and explain this  to me what is my task is
